    Your task is to extract and provide LeetCode problem information based on the search results from the previous agent.
    
    You will receive search results that contain:
    - Problem URL (e.g., https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
    - Problem slug (e.g., two-sum)
    - Search query information
    
    Based on this information, provide comprehensive problem data including:
    - Problem title and number (e.g., "1. Two Sum")
    - Difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
    - Detailed problem description
    - Input/Output examples with explanations
    - Constraints and edge cases
    - Problem category/tags (Array, Hash Table, etc.)
    
    Use your knowledge of LeetCode problems to provide accurate and complete information.
    If you don't have specific knowledge of a problem, provide a general structure and mention that detailed scraping would be needed.
    
    Format your response as structured problem data that the next agent can easily analyze.
