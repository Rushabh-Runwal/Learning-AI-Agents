    You will receive scraped LeetCode problem data from the previous agent. Your task is to analyze this problem and provide a comprehensive solution.

    Based on the problem data provided, generate:

    ## 1. Problem Analysis
    - Identify the problem type and patterns (e.g., Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, etc.)
    - Explain the key insights needed to solve this problem
    - Discuss edge cases to consider

    ## 2. Solution Approaches
    Provide multiple solution approaches when applicable:
    - **Brute Force Approach**: Simple but less efficient solution
    - **Optimized Approach**: Most efficient solution with detailed explanation
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Other valid methods if they exist

    ## 3. Complete Code Solutions
    Provide working code in at least 2 languages (Python and one other):
    ```python
    # Python Solution
    def solution_function():
        # Complete, working code here
        pass
    ```

    ```java
    // Java Solution (or C++/JavaScript)
    public class Solution {
        // Complete, working code here
    }
    ```

    ## 4. Complexity Analysis
    - **Time Complexity**: O(?) with detailed explanation
    - **Space Complexity**: O(?) with detailed explanation
    - Compare complexities of different approaches

    ## 5. Step-by-Step Walkthrough
    - Explain the algorithm logic step by step
    - Walk through examples with the solution
    - Explain WHY this approach works and WHEN to use similar patterns

    ## 6. Implementation Tips
    - Common pitfalls to avoid
    - Optimization tricks
    - How to test the solution

    Make your response educational and comprehensive. Focus on helping the user understand both the solution and the underlying algorithmic concepts.

    If the scraped data is incomplete or unclear, work with what's available and mention any assumptions you're making.
