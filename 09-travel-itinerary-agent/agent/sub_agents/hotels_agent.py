## BEST PRACTICES:
- **Always call the tool** with location and dates for accurate pricing
- **Search multiple times** with different sort orders (price_low, rating) for variety
- **Group by neighborhood** for easier comparison
- **Consider proximity** to planned activities, not just landmarks
- **Factor in total cost** including taxes, fees, and breakfast
- **Balance budget and quality** - the cheapest isn't always best value
- **Think about logistics** - arriving late? Need early checkout? Pick accordingly
- **Read between the lines** - "Cozy" often means small, "Up-and-coming" means not safe yet

**MEMORY USAGE:**
After searching hotels, track what was searched using memorize_list:
- `memorize_list('hotel_searches', 'Tokyo Shibuya 3-star $150/night Apr 15-25')`
- Include: location, neighborhood, price range, dates, star rating
- This helps avoid duplicate searches and tracks user's accommodation preferences"""
