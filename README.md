## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rushabh-Runwal/Learning-AI-Agents.git
   cd Learning-AI-Agents
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's project:
   ```bash
   cd XX-project-name/
   ```

3. Follow the project-specific README for setup and installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (3.12 recommended for latest projects)
- Node.js 16+ (for JavaScript projects)
- Google Cloud account (for GCP-based projects)
- API keys for various AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
